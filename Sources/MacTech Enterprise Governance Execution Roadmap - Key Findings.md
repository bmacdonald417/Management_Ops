# MacTech Enterprise Governance Execution Roadmap - Key Findings

## Executive Overview

**Objective:** Create a defensible, scalable, audit-ready federal contracting infrastructure within a 12-month execution cycle.

**Implementation Phases:** Four maturity phases
1. Foundation (0-90 Days)
2. Structural Enforcement (90-180 Days)
3. Operational Integration (180-270 Days)
4. Enterprise Optimization (270-365 Days)

## Phase II – Structural Enforcement (90-180 Days)

**Key Deliverables:**
- Build automated indirect rate calculator
- Implement quarterly allowability review protocol
- Formalize indemnification classification and escalation workflow
- Document and enforce CUI system boundary
- Deploy incident response and 72-hour reporting framework

**Outcome:** Contractual, financial, and cyber enforcement controls active

---

## Phase III – Operational Integration (180-270 Days)

**Key Deliverables:**
- Deploy Governance KPI Dashboard
- Implement subcontractor cyber affirmation process
- Conduct internal mock CMMC readiness review
- Establish annual governance audit cycle
- Implement funding threshold monitoring

**Outcome:** Governance performance measurable and tracked
