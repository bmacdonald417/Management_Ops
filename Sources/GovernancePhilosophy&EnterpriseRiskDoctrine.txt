Appendix H complete.
APPENDIX I
FAR PART 31 ALLOWABILITY SUMMARY & ENTERPRISE COST COMPLIANCE DOCTRINE
________________


I.1 Purpose
This Appendix establishes MacTech Solutions LLC’s internal allowability governance doctrine in alignment with:
• FAR Part 31 – Contract Cost Principles and Procedures
• Allocability doctrine
• Reasonableness standard
• Consistency requirement
This Appendix provides structured guidance for:
• Expense classification
• Indirect pool integrity
• Unallowable segregation
• Audit defensibility
Failure to properly classify costs may result in:
• Disallowed costs
• Indirect rate adjustments
• False Claims exposure
• Contract repayment
________________


I.2 The Three Core Allowability Tests
All costs charged to federal contracts must satisfy:
1. Allowable
Permitted under FAR Part 31.
2. Allocable
Assignable to a specific contract or cost objective.
3. Reasonable
Reflects sound business judgment.
Failure to meet any of the three renders the cost unallowable.
________________


I.3 Generally Allowable Costs
(If Reasonable and Allocable)
• Direct labor
• Materials and supplies
• Travel (at reasonable rates)
• Rent and utilities
• Professional services (legal/accounting)
• Insurance
• Depreciation
• Software subscriptions supporting operations
• Training related to contract performance
Allowability may depend on contract type.
________________


I.4 Expressly Unallowable Costs
The following are unallowable under FAR Part 31:
• Alcohol
• Entertainment
• Lobbying
• Political contributions
• Fines and penalties
• Bad debts
• Donations and charitable contributions
• Losses on other contracts
These must be coded separately.
Reference:
Appendix H – Unallowable Segregation Controls
________________


I.5 Conditionally Allowable / Gray Area Costs
Certain costs require careful review:
Executive Compensation
Must be reasonable and not excessive.
Marketing & Business Development
Allowable if not contingent lobbying.
Travel Upgrades
Luxury travel is unallowable.
Legal Settlements
May be partially unallowable.
Advertising
Allowable only if for recruitment or general business promotion (not lobbying).
Gray area costs require documented review.
Reference:
MAC-FRM-170 Allowability Review Checklist
________________


I.6 Allocability Doctrine
A cost is allocable if it:
• Is incurred specifically for the contract
• Benefits both contract and other work and can be distributed proportionally
• Is necessary to overall business operation
Improper allocation is a common audit finding.
________________


I.7 Consistency Requirement
Costs must be treated consistently.
Example:
If treated as indirect in one instance, cannot later be charged direct without justification.
Consistency supports indirect rate defensibility.
________________


I.8 Unallowable Cost Segregation Requirements
Unallowable costs must:
• Be coded to separate GL accounts
• Not be included in indirect pools
• Not be billed to contract
• Be excluded from rate calculation
Quarterly review required.
________________


I.9 Quarterly Allowability Review
MacTech shall conduct quarterly review including:
• Expense sampling
• Unallowable account validation
• Indirect pool verification
• Documentation spot-check
Findings documented and retained.
________________


I.10 False Claims Risk Awareness
Charging unallowable costs knowingly may trigger:
• False Claims Act exposure
• Civil penalties
• Treble damages
• Criminal liability
Internal compliance reduces risk.
________________


I.11 Documentation Retention
Retain:
• Receipts
• Invoices
• Justification memos
• Expense approvals
Retention minimum six (6) years.
